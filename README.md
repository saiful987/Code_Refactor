# Code_Refactor

# Description

This assignment was attended to remove div and spand, since it tells nothing about its content. Best way to make other devolpers understand what is going on is using semantic elements. These elements were used to replace div and spand. Anyone can go into the code and replace any line of code as they please. This website has three navigation links at the top , where if they were clicked, it would take the user to the appropriate sections of the page. Also, it contains information that are imporant, which are in the middle on the webpage, wheres there is information on the side, which are not very important that is know as "aside". The footer is all the way at the bottom of the page, which at first had div as its tag, but was changed to footer.
